Project Description:

 

<h2>Part 1 Validation</h2>

<p>Create a class with a method that accepts a charge account number as its argument and save ValidatorYourLastName.java. The method should determine whether the number is valid by comparing it to the following list of valid charge account numbers:
</p>

<table style="border-collapse: collapse;">
	<tbody>
		<tr>
			<td>5658845</td>
			<td>4520125</td> 
			<td>7895122</td> 
			<td>8777541</td> 
			<td>8451277</td> 
			<td>1302850</td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td>8080152</td> 
			<td>4562555</td> 
			<td>5552012</td> 
			<td>5050552</td> 
			<td>7825877</td> 
			<td>1250255</td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td>1005231</td> 
			<td>6545231</td> 
			<td>3852085</td> 
			<td>7576651</td> 
			<td>7881200</td> 
			<td>4581002</td>
		</tr>
	</tbody>
</table>
<p>These numbers should be stored in an array. Use a sequential search to locate the number passed as an argument. If the number is in the array, the method should return true, indicating the number is valid. If the number is not in the array, the method should return false, indicating the number is invalid. 
</p>
<p>Write a program that tests the class by asking the user to enter a charge account number. The program should display a message indicating whether the number is valid or invalid and save as TestValidatorYourLastName.java.
</p>
<p>Lastly, modify the program you wrote so it performs a binary search to locate valid account numbers. Use your choice of sorting algorithm to sort the array before the binary search is performed.
</p>

<h2>Part 2 Sorting</h2>

<p>Implement the recursive algorithm for array-based merge sort. Write a demo program to test the merge sort implementation. Save the files as MergeSortRecursiveYourlastname.java and DriverMSRecursiveYourlastname.java.
